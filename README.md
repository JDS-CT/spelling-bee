My daughter Emilia took part in a spelling bee on February 17, 2011, so I wrote
a couple of programs to help her practice for it.

The first program I wrote (bee.sh) is a Linux command line program that uses
espeak to read out the word and the spelling. She used this version with her
classmates to practice for the real thing.

The second program is an HTML version that uses jQuery and Google
Translate's text-to-speech function. It should work in most modern
browsers. Due to cross-domain restrictions from Google Translate it only
works locally, so just open index.html in a browser.

This was modified to allow my child to type the words spoken, because I learned typing as a child but not spelling by copying what I saw. This is an experiment to see if both can happen together.

It works for weekly spelling tests, but for general use we have mostly been training typing with "typespeed", the added pressure of learning both typing and spelling at the same time is too much if it is the only learning technique. Limiting this technique to weekly spelling tests is more reasonable. (Need a cleaner voice synthesis tool this one is difficult to understand for some words).
